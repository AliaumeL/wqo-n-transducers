  A fundamental construction in formal language theory
  is the Myhill-Nerode congruence on words,
  whose finitedness characterizes regular language.
  This construction was generalized to functions
  from $\Sigma^*$ to $\mathbb{Z}$ 
  by Colcombet, Dou√©neau-Tabot, and Lopez
  to characterize
  the class of so-called $\mathbb{Z}$-polyregular functions.
  In this paper, we relax the notion of equivalence relation
  to quasi-ordering in order to study the class of functions
  from $\Sigma^*$ to $\mathbb{N}$. The analogue of
  having a finite index is then being a well-quasi-ordering.
  This provides a canonical object to describe $\mathbb{N}$-polyregular functions,
  which was lacking prior to this work.
